Arguing that OpenShift is "better", although Rancher seems to be really good for a lot of cases.

* Openshift is backed by Red Hat and has really good support from them
* It has Great security
* Really Well documented
* It is an actual distribution of Kubernetes
* Self scaling of itself and resources
* Better market presence
* Open source

Overall it is still very much depending on the needs and if Red Hat systems are already in use or if the Red Hat ecosystem is going to be used.
